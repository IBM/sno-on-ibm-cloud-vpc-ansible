                The GUI env with VNC access has been configured !
                You need to set your VNC password before accessing via VNC.
                Login in via SSH using the command:
                     ssh -i {{ playbook_dir }}/auth/{{ name_prefix }}-local-id_rsa kvmadmin@{{ fip.address }}
                Set the VNC password by running the following command:
                    vncpasswd
                You will also need to set a password for the kvmadmin user because the
                GNOME desktop has a lock screen that requires that  password to unlock.
                Run the following commands in the same SSH session to set the kvmadmin user password:
                    sudo bash
                    passwd kvmadmin
                    exit
                That's it ! You can access via VNC now by pointing your VNC client to:
                   {{ fip.address }}:5901  and entering your VNC password when prompted.

      debug:
        msg: "{{ msg.split('\n') }}"
