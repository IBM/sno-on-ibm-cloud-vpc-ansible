                The GUI env with RDP access has been configured !
                You will need to set a password for the kvmadmin user because RDP
                clients will require one

                To set the kvmadmin password login in via SSH using the command:

                    ssh root@{{ fip.address }}

                Then run the following command:

                    passwd kvmadmin

                That's it ! You can access via RDP by pointing your RDP client to:

                   {{ fip.address }}:3389

                and entering the kvmadmin uaer password when prompted.
